# OBS Text Counter
The OBS text counter is a tool that simply increments or decrements a value when a keybind is pressed. This tool is useful for anything from a kill counter to tracking how many pushups you need to do.

## How to use
Drag the counter.txt into OBS or SLOBS and run main.py answering the prompts as they appear.

## Keybinds
Keybinds must not have spaces in them. Keybinds must be written like this: "space+ctrl+l".
