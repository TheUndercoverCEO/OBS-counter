# OBS Text Counter
The OBS text counter is a tool that simply increments a value when ctrl+l is pressed. This tool is useful for anything from a kill counter to tracking how many pushups you need to do. This tool is currently useable but more features will be developed later. Thank you for understanding.

## Changelog
